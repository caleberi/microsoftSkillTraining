*The continuous change in the technological trend of the world excites me and also causes me to continuously update my existing knowledge about it and the theory behind each innovation. I want to help other students to explore and learn because there are still quite a large number of students that do not know about existing technological tools that can help them grow in whatever they do. And also  it is quite challenging to keep up with every day technological innovation and discoveries so helping students understand how to keep up is also one of the reasons i like to help them learn


*To explain a technical concept to a friend or peer. I  would first of all break the concept into fragments .however if this fragment requires visualization then a simple graphical application will be employed, followed by an example. The fragment or sub-conceptual overview of the concept will be combined to further explain the total meaning of the concept.
For example, explaining the concept of LinkedList in computer science to a fellow student can be done by graphically using a diagram or by using common ideas like a connected carriage on a train. The use of common idea will enable the peer to easily understand the concept


*To get the student to attend an event been hosted in my school, I will first create awareness using posters, social media such as Twitter and WhatsApp. This will contain information about the benefit of attending the event and also the lesson to be learned in the event . Also creating a Q&A discussion medium to answer student's pre-event questions which will clear up any doubt about attending the event.
